CMake is great, and so is Android. This is a collection of CMake scripts, and
patches for common libraries that may be useful to the Android NDK community.
It is based on experience from porting OpenCV library to Android.

Main goal is to share these scripts so that devs that use CMake as their build
system may easily compile native code for Android.

This project includes ports of the follow:

* boost
* eigen
* glues

And a few samples, to get you started.

Also, used by the OpenCV project: http://opencv.org/android

``Intention of this fork``

If you havn't noticed the original project "android.cmake" has some significant
differences from most other "toolchans" for CMake. Aim of this project to make 
it more friendly to other toolchains.

 * Correct build/output directory handling
 * Friendly configuration in cmake-gui
 * Mutiple build targets
